## Neck

- @McElhaney1988: Constant velocity tests (also upto failure). C1-T1. Two boundary conditions for constant velocity - pinned-pinned and fixed-pinned. Compared with Hybrid III. Moment-rotation curves (also upto failure)
- @Myers1989: Cervical spine torsion. 6 full cervical spine and 6 lower spine tests.
- @McGill1994: 40 males, 19 female volunteers (university student population). Flexion, extension, lateral bending.
- @Nightingale1996: whole unembalmed heads and cervical spines drop at 3.2 ms−1

### Cervical Spine Segments

- @Nightingale2007: 41 male spinal segments (O–C2, C4–C5, C6–C7) in a pure-moment
- @Muthseng2019: 9 cadaveric cervical FSUs loaded under 10 Nm **flexion** moment, relative vertebral and **facet rotations and displacements** assessed using radio-opaque markers implanted in each vertebra
