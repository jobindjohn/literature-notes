  abstract = {Cervical traumas are among the most common events leading to serious spinal cord injuries. While models are often used to better understand injury mechanisms, experimental data for their validation remain sparse, particularly regarding articular facets. The aim of this study was to assess the behavior of cervical FSUs under quasi-static flexion with a specific focus on facet tracking. 9 cadaveric cervical FSUs were imaged and loaded under a 10 Nm flexion moment, exerted incrementally, while biplanar X-rays were acquired at each load increment. The relative vertebral and facet rotations and displacements were assessed using radio-opaque markers implanted in each vertebra and CT-based reconstructions registered on the radiographs. The only failures obtained were due to specimen preparation, indicating a failure moment of cervical FSUs greater than 10 Nm in quasistatic flexion. Facet motions displayed a consistent anterior sliding and a variable pattern regarding their normal displacement. The present study offers insight on the behavior of cervical FSUs under quasi-static flexion beyond physiological thresholds with accurate facet tracking. The data provided should prove useful to further understand injury mechanisms and validate models.},

  abstract = {This study explores the inertial effects of the head and torso on cervical spine dynamics with the specific goal of determining whether the head mass can provide a constraining cervical spine end condition. The hypothesis was tested using a low friction impact surface and a pocketing foam impact surface. Impact orientation was also varied. Tests were conducted on whole unembalmed heads and cervical spines using a drop track system to produce impact velocities on the order of 3.2 ms−1. Data for the head impact forces and the reactions at T1 were recorded and the tests were also imaged at 1000 frames s−1. Injuries occurred 2–19 ms following head impact and prior to significant head motion. Average compressive load a failure was 1727 ± 387 N. Decoupling was observed between the head and T1. Cervical spine loading due to head rebound constituted up to 54 ± 16\% of the total axial neck load for padded impacts and up to 38 ± 30\% of the total axial neck load for rigid impacts. Dynamic buckling was also observed; including first-order modes and transient higher-order modes which shifted the structure from a primarily compressive mode of deformation to various bending modes. These experiments demonstrate that in the absence of head pocketing, the head mass can provide sufficient constraint to cause cervical spine injury. The results also show that cervical spinal injury dynamics are complex, and that a large sample size of experimentally produced injuries will be necessary to develop comprehensive neck injury models and criteria.},

  abstract = {New vehicle safety standards are designed to limit the amount of neck tension and extension seen by out-of-position motor vehicle occupants during airbag deployments. The criteria used to assess airbag injury risk are currently based on volunteer data and animal studies due to a lack of bending tolerance data for the adult cervical spine. This study provides quantitative data on the flexion–extension bending properties and strength on the male cervical spine, and tests the hypothesis that the male is stronger than the female in pure bending. An additional objective is to determine if there are significant differences in stiffness and strength between the male upper and lower cervical spine. Pure-moment flexibility and failure testing was conducted on 41 male spinal segments (O–C2, C4–C5, C6–C7) in a pure-moment test frame and the results were compared with a previous study of females. Failures were conducted at approximately 90N-m/s. In extension, the male upper cervical spine (O–C2) fails at a moment of 49.5 (s.d. 17.6)N-m and at an angle of 42.4° (s.d. 8.0°). In flexion, the mean moment at failure is 39.0 (s.d. 6.3°) N-m and an angle of 58.7° (s.d. 5.1°). The difference in strength between flexion and extension is not statistically significant. The difference in the angles is statistically significant. The upper cervical spine was significantly stronger than the lower cervical spine in both flexion and extension. The male upper cervical spine was significantly stiffer than the female and significantly stronger than the female in flexion. Odontoid fractures were the most common injury produced in extension, suggesting a tensile mechanism due to tensile loads in the odontoid ligamentous complex.},

  abstract   = {Background Accurate knowledge of the intervertebral center of rotation (COR) and its corresponding range of motion (ROM) can help understand development of cervical pathology and guide surgical treatment. Methods Ten asymptomatic subjects were imaged using MRI and dual fluoroscopic imaging techniques during dynamic extension-flexion-extension (EFE) and axial left-right-left (LRL) rotation. The intervertebral segment CORs and ROMs were measured from C34 to C67, as the correlations between two variables were analyzed as well. Results During the EFE motion, the CORs were located at 32.4 ± 20.6\%, -2.4 ± 11.7\%, 21.8 ± 12.5\% and 32.3 ± 25.5\% posteriorly, and the corresponding ROMs were 13.8 ± 4.3°, 15.1 ± 5.1°, 14.4 ± 7.0° and 9.2 ± 4.3° from C34 to C67. The ROM of C67 was significantly smaller than other segments. The ROMs were not shown to significantly correlate to COR locations (r = −0.243, p = 0.132). During the LRL rotation cycle, the average CORs were at 85.6 ± 18.2\%, 32.3 ± 25.3\%, 15.7 ± 12.3\% and 82.4 ± 31.3\% posteriorly, and the corresponding ROMs were 3.5 ± 1.7°, 6.9 ± 3.8°, 9.6 ± 4.1° and 2.6 ± 2.5° from C34 to C67. The ROMs of C34 and C67 was significantly smaller than those of C45 and C56. A more posterior COR was associated with a less ROM during the neck rotation (r = −0.583, p {\textless} 0.001). The ROMs during EFE were significantly larger than those during LRL in each intervertebral level. Conclusion The CORs and ROMs of the subaxial cervical intervertebral segments were segment level- and neck motion-dependent during the in-vivo neck motions. The translational potential of this article Our study indicates that the subaxial cervical intervertebral CORs and ROMs were segment level- and neck motion-dependent. This may help to improve the artificial disc design as well as surgical technique by which the neck functional motion is restored following the cervical arthroplasty.},

  abstract = {Objective This study examined cervical center of rotation (COR) positions in 7 postures using validated cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) combined with 3D–3D registration in healthy volunteers. Methods CBCT scans were performed on 20 healthy volunteers in 7 functional positions, constructing a three-dimensional (3D) model. Images were registered to the neutral position using 3D–3D registration, allowing analysis of kinematic differences and rotational axes. COR measurements were obtained for each segment (C2/3 to C6/7) in each posture. Results The CORs of C2/3 to C6/7 were predominantly posterior (−5.3 ± 3.8 ∼ −0.6 ± 1.2 mm) and superior (16.5 ± 6.0 ∼ 23.6 ± 3.2 mm) to the intervertebral disc's geometric center (GC) in flexion and extension. However, the C4/5 segment's COR was anterior to the GC (2.0 ± 9.8 mm) during flexion and close to it in the right-left direction. During left-right twisting, the CORs of C2/3-C6/7 were posterior (−21.8 ± 10.5 ∼-0.9 ± 0.8 mm) and superior (3.1 ± 7.5 ∼23.2 ± 3.6 mm) to the GCs in anterior-posterior and superior-inferior directions, without consistent right-left directionality. During left-right bending, each segment's COR was predominantly posterior (−25.2 ± 13.1 ∼-6.5 ± 9.9 mm) and superior (0.3 ± 12.5 ∼12.1 ± 5.1 mm) to the GC in anterior-posterior and superior-inferior directions, except for the C2/3 segment, located inferiorly (−5.9 ± 4.1 mm) in left bending. The right-left COR position varied across segments. Conclusions Our findings reveal segment-specific and posture-dependent COR variations. Notably, the CORs of C3/4, C4/5, and C5/6 consistently align near the intervertebral disc's GC at different postures, supporting their suitability for total disc replacement surgery within the C3/4 to C5/6 segments.},

  abstract = {The kinematics of the cervical spine during various functional neck motions has been widely reported. However, no data has been reported on the cervical intervertebral kinematics during walking, the most frequently performed daily functional activity. In this study, we evaluated cervical kinematics and disc deformation of asymptomatic subjects during a gait cycle using a dual fluoroscopic imaging system. Our measurements showed that the vertical translation of the cervical spine (1.6 ± 0.1 Hz) occurred at twice the frequency of the gait cycle (0.8 ± 0.1 Hz). The overall ranges of motion (ROMs) of the entire (C2-T1) cervical spine were 5.0 ± 3.1° in the flexion-extension rotation, 3.4 ± 1.0° in the lateral-bending rotation, and 5.8 ± 2.1° in the axial-twisting rotation during walking. Each intervertebral disc (measured at the disc centre location) dynamically deformed in its axial direction in a range of 16.2 ± 5.7\% {\textasciitilde} 23.7 ± 8.7\% (without significant differences among different segment levels, p {\textgreater} 0.05), similar to the ranges of shear deformations of the same disc (p {\textgreater} 0.05, except for the C7-T1 disc, where p = 0.010).

This study investigated in vivo kinematics of the entire head-neck complex (C0-T1) of eight female asymptomatic subjects during dynamic left–right head axial rotation using a dual fluoroscopic imaging system and 3D-to-2D registration techniques. During one-sided head rotation (i.e., left or right head rotation), the primary rotation of the overall head-neck complex (C0-T1) reached 55.5 ± 10.8°, the upper cervical spine region (C0-2) had a primary axial rotation of 39.7 ± 9.6° (71.3 ± 8.5\% of the overall C0-T1 axial rotation), and the lower cervical spine region (C2-T1) had a primary rotation of 10.0 ± 3.7° (18.6 ± 7.2\% of the overall C0-T1 axial rotation). Coupled bending rotations occurred in the upper and lower cervical spine regions in similar magnitude but opposite directions (upper: contralateral bending of 18.2 ± 5.9° versus lower: ipsilateral bending of 21.4 ± 5.1°), resulting in a compensatory cervical lateral curvature that balances the head to rotate horizontally. Furthermore, upper cervical segments (C0-1 or C1-2) provided main mobility in different rotational degrees of freedom needed for head axial rotations. Additionally, we quantitatively described both coupled segmental motions (flexion–extension and lateral bending) by correlation with the overall primary axial rotation of the head-neck complex. This investigation offers comprehensive baseline data regarding primary and coupled motions of craniocervical segments during head axial rotation.},

  abstract   = {Knowledge of spinal kinematics is essential for the diagnosis and management of spinal diseases. Distinguishing between physiological and pathological motion patterns can help diagnose these diseases, plan surgical interventions and improve relevant tools and software. During the last decades, numerous studies based on diverse methodologies attempted to elucidate spinal mobility in different planes of motion. The authors aimed to summarize and compare the evidence about cervical spine kinematics under healthy and degenerative conditions. This includes an illustrated description of the spectrum of physiological cervical spine kinematics, followed by a comparable presentation of kinematics of the degenerative cervical spine. Data was obtained through a systematic MEDLINE search including studies on angular/translational segmental motion contribution, range of motion, coupling and center of rotation. As far as the degenerative conditions are concerned, kinematic data regarding disc degeneration and spondylolisthesis were available. Although the majority of the studies identified repeating motion patterns for most motion planes, discrepancies associated with limited sample sizes and different imaging techniques and/or spine configurations, were noted. Among healthy/asymptomatic individuals, flexion extension (FE) and lateral bending (LB) are mainly facilitated by the subaxial cervical spine. C4–C5 and C5–C6 were the major FE contributors in the reported studies, exceeding the motion contribution of sub-adjacent segments. Axial rotation (AR) greatly depends on C1–C2. FE range of motion (ROM) is distributed between the atlantoaxial and subaxial segments, while AR ROM stems mainly from the former and LB ROM from the latter. In coupled motion rotation is quantitatively predominant over translation. Motion migrates caudally from C1–C2 and the center of rotation (COR) translocates anteriorly and superiorly for each successive subaxial segment. In degenerative settings, concurrent or subsequent lesions render the association between diseases and mobility alterations challenging. The affected segments seem to maintain translational and angular motion in early and moderate degeneration. However, the progression of degeneration restrains mobility, which seems to be maintained or compensated by adjacent non-affected segments. While the kinematics of the healthy cervical spine have been addressed by multiple studies, the entire nosological and kinematic spectrum of cervical spine degeneration is partially addressed. Large—scale in vivo studies can complement the existing evidence, cover the gaps and pave the way to technological and clinical breakthroughs.},

  abstract   = {Study Design: In vitro biomechanical study. Objective: The strength of the alar ligament has been described inconsistently, possibly because of the nonphysiological biomechanical testing models, and the inability to test the ligament with both attachments simultaneously. The purpose of this biomechanical model was to reevaluate the alar ligament’s tensile strength with both bony attachments, while also keeping the transverse ligament intact, all in a more physiological biomechanical model that mimics the mechanism of traumatic injury closely. Methods: Eleven fresh-frozen occipito-atlanto-axial (C0-C1-C2) specimens were harvested from individuals whose mean age at death was 77.4 years (range 46-97 years). Only the alar and transverse ligaments were preserved, and the bony C0-C1-C2 complex was left intact. Axial tension was exerted on the dens to displace it posteriorly, while the occipito-axial complex was fixed anteriorly. A device that applies controlled increasing force was used to test the tensile strength (M2-200, Mark-10 Corporation). Results: The mean force required for the alar ligament to fail was 394 ± 52 N (range 317-503 N). However, both the right and left alar ligaments ruptured simultaneously in 10 specimens. The ligament failed most often at the dens (n = 10), followed by occipital condyle rupture (n = 1). The transverse ligament remained intact in all specimens. Conclusions: When both the right and left alar ligament were included, the total alar ligament failure occurred at an average force of 394 N. The alar ligament failed before the transverse ligament.},

  abstract = {Background Cervical sagittal alignment is crucial for distributing the head load to lower cervical segments and maintaining normal cervical spine function, but its biomechanical effect on the cervical spine was not fully elucidated. Objective To investigate the effect of cervical sagittal alignment on dynamic intervertebral kinematics. Design Cross-sectional study. Methods Healthy participants without neck pain were recruited and divided into lordosis, straight and kyphosis groups according to the C2–C7 Cobb angle at the neutral position. The anti-directional and total joint motions were extracted across 10 epochs of dynamic cervical flexion and extension movements. Results /findings: The overall anti-directional joint motion during flexion is larger in the kyphosis group when compared with the lordosis group (p = 0.021), while the range of flexion is smaller in the kyphosis group than that in the lordosis group (p = 0.017). The C2/C3 anti-directional joint motion during extension in the straight group is larger than that in the lordosis group (p = 0016). The range of extension in the kyphosis group (p {\textless} 0.001) and the straight group (p = 0.002) are larger than that in the lordosis group. The increased range of extension in the kyphosis and straight groups were mainly from the C3/C4, C4/C5, and C5/C6 joints(p {\textless} 0.05). Conclusion Changes in cervical sagittal alignment alter both the quality and quantity of the individual joint motions. More adjustments are required by the cervical joints to complete neck movements with the loss of lordosis. The lordotic curvature is a relatively effort-saving mode for the cervical spine from a biomechanical perspective.},

  abstract = {The in vivo intervertebral range of motion (ROM) is an important predictor for spinal disorders. While the subaxial cervical spine has been extensively studied, the motion characteristics of the occipito-atlantal (C0-1) and atlanto-axial (C1-2) cervical segments were less reported due to technical difficulties in accurate imaging of these two segments. In this study, we investigated the intervertebral ROMs of the entire cervical spine (C0-T1) during in vivo functional neck motions of asymptomatic human subjects, including maximal flexion-extension, left-right lateral bending, and left-right axial torsion, using previously validated dual fluoroscopic imaging and model registration techniques. During all neck motions, C0-1, similar to C7-T1, was substantially less mobile than other segments and always contributed less than 10\% of the cervical rotations. During the axial rotation of the neck, C1-2 contributed 73.2 ± 17.3\% of the cervical rotation, but each of other segments contributed less than 10\% of the cervical rotation. During both lateral bending and axial torsion neck motions, regardless of primary or coupled motions, the axial torsion ROM of C1-2 was significantly greater than its lateral bending ROM (p {\textless} 0.001), whereas the opposite differences were consistently observed at subaxial segments. This study reveals that there are distinct motion patterns at upper and lower cervical segments during in vivo neck motions. The reported data could be useful for the development of new diagnosis methods of cervical pathologies and new surgical techniques that aim to restore normal cervical segmental motion.},

  abstract = {Functional neck motion is achieved by the cervical segments with each composed of an intervertebral disc (IVD) and two facet joints (FJs). Using biplane fluoroscopic imaging, we investigated the ranges of motion (ROMs) of the three joints in the cervical spines (from C3 to C7) of eighteen asymptomatic subjects. Three functional neck motions were examined, including flexion–extension (FE), lateral bending (LB) and axial twisting (AT). Our measurements showed that the translations of both IVD and FJs primarily occurred in the sagittal plane during all neck motions, and the anteroposterior translations of IVDs were significantly smaller than those of the corresponding FJs (p {\textless} 0.05) at all segments. For example, the ranges of IVD and FJ anteroposterior translations at C3/4 were 2.7 ± 0.7 mm vs. 3.5 ± 1.1 mm in FE, 0.9 ± 0.5 mm vs. 4.6 ± 1.1 mm in LB, and 1.0 ± 0.5 mm vs. 3.1 ± 1.0 mm in AT. Furthermore, we introduced an IVD-FJ translation ratio, which represents the ratio of the IVD to FJ translational ROMs. In FE neck motion, the IVD-FJ anteroposterior translation ratios decreased from 0.81 ± 0.18 at C3 to 0.52 ± 0.19 at C3, indicating gradually increasing resistances of IVDs compared to FJs from the proximal to distal levels. In LB neck motion, the smallest IVD-FJ translation ratios (0.14 ± 0.09 and 0.43 ± 0.30) occurred at C4/5 for both anteroposterior and left–right translations. In AT neck motion, the largest IVD-FJ anteroposterior translation ratio (0.42 ± 0.21) occurred at C3/4, and was significantly different from those at C4/5 and C5/6 (p {\textless} 0.05). These data could be used as references for improving motion-preserving cervical treatment methods that aimed to achieve the normal ranges of translational motions of both IVD and FJs.},

  abstract   = {The biomechanical function of the intervertebral disc (IVD) is a critical indicator of tissue health and pathology. The mechanical responses (displacements, strain) of the IVD to physiologic movement can be spatially complex and depend on tissue architecture, consisting of distinct compositional regions and integrity; however, IVD biomechanics are predominately uncharacterized in vivo. Here, we measured voxel-level displacement and strain patterns in adjacent IVDs in vivo by coupling magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with cyclic motion of the cervical spine. Across adjacent disc segments, cervical flexion–extension of 10° resulted in first principal and maximum shear strains approaching 10\%. Intratissue spatial analysis of the cervical IVDs, not possible with conventional techniques, revealed elevated maximum shear strains located in the posterior disc (nucleus pulposus) regions. IVD structure, based on relaxometric patterns of T2 and T1ρ images, did not correlate spatially with functional metrics of strain. Our approach enables a comprehensive IVD biomechanical analysis of voxel-level, intratissue strain patterns in adjacent discs in vivo, which are largely independent of MRI relaxometry. The spatial mapping of IVD biomechanics in vivo provides a functional assessment of adjacent IVDs in subjects, and provides foundational biomarkers for elastography, differentiation of disease state, and evaluation of treatment efficacy.},

  abstract = {Background Frequently, treatment decisions for craniocervical injuries and instability are based on imaging findings, but in vivo ligament kinematics were poorly understood. This study was to determine in vivo deformation patterns of primary ligaments in the craniocervical junction (i.e., C0–2), including the cruciform ligament, alar ligaments, and accessory ligaments, during dynamic head axial rotation. Methods The skulls and cervical spines of eight asymptomatic female subjects were dynamically imaged using a biplane fluoroscopic imaging system, when they performed left and right head axial rotations. Using a 3D-to-2D registration technique, the in vivo positions and orientations of cervical segments were determined. An optimization algorithm was implemented to determine ligament wrapping paths, and the resulting ligament deformations were represented by percent elongations. Using paired t-tests, ligament deformations in the end-range position were compared to those in the neutral position. Findings No significant differences were observed in segmental motions during left and right head rotations (p {\textgreater} 0.05). In general, slight deformations occurred in each component of the cruciform ligament. For the alar ligaments, the ipsilateral ligament was lengthened from −0.7 ± 13.8\% to 16.6 ± 15.7\% (p {\textless} 0.001*). For the accessory ligaments, the contralateral ligament was lengthened from −2.9 ± 7.5\% to 10.1 ± 6.2\% (p {\textless} 0.001*). Interpretation This study reveals that there are distinct deformation patterns in craniocervical junction ligaments during dynamic axial head rotation. These ligament deformation data can enhance our understanding of the synergic function of craniocervical junction ligaments, and guide the treatment of craniocervical instability.},

To measure the tensile strength, a tensile testing machine (M2-200, Mark-10 Corporation, Copiague, New York, USA) was used in this study. Results The force (N) necessary until failure for all alar ligaments ranged from 87–346 N with a mean of 186.9 ± 69.7 N. There was a significant difference when comparing tensile strength between males and females. Conclusions Further studies will be necessary to determine their importance as secondary stabilizers and measure their ability to support similar forces when subject to rotation and lateral bending forces, as well as with flexion-extension.},

  abstract   = {Previous studies indicate that maximum upper cervical axial rotation occurs only through a combination of transverse, frontal, and sagittal plane motions. This study explores the relationship between transection of the alar ligament and combined upper cervical axial rotation movements. Ten cryopreserved upper cervical spines were manually mobilized in bilateral axial rotation and two different motion combinations with simultaneous motion in the three anatomical planes: rotation in extension (extension + axial rotation + contralateral lateral bending) and rotation in flexion (flexion + axial rotation + ipsilateral lateral bending). These three motions were performed before and after right alar ligament transection. The occiput-axis axial rotation was measured using an optical motion capture system while measuring the applied load. With intact alar ligament, the axial rotation in flexion showed the lowest range of motion (right, R: 9.81 ± 3.89°; left, L: 15.54 ± 5.89°). Similar results were found between the other two mobilizations: axial rotation (R: 33.87 ± 6.64°; L: 27.99 ± 6.90°) and rotation in extension (R: 35.15 ± 5.97°; L: 28.96 ± 6.47°). After right alar ligament transection, rotation in flexion (particularly in left rotation) showed the largest increase in motion: rotation in flexion (R: 13.78 ± 9.63°; L: 23.04 ± 5.59°), rotation in extension (R: 36.39 ± 7.10°; L: 31.71 ± 7.67°), and axial rotation (R: 38.50 ± 9.47°; L: 31.59 ± 6.55°). Different combinations of movements should be evaluated when analyzing the maximum axial rotation of the upper cervical spine, as axial rotation alone and rotation in extension showed a larger range of motion than rotation in flexion. After unilateral alar ligament injury, rotation to the non-injured side in flexion demonstrates the most movement increase.},
