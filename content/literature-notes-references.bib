  abstract = {New vehicle safety standards are designed to limit the amount of neck tension and extension seen by out-of-position motor vehicle occupants during airbag deployments. The criteria used to assess airbag injury risk are currently based on volunteer data and animal studies due to a lack of bending tolerance data for the adult cervical spine. This study provides quantitative data on the flexion–extension bending properties and strength on the male cervical spine, and tests the hypothesis that the male is stronger than the female in pure bending. An additional objective is to determine if there are significant differences in stiffness and strength between the male upper and lower cervical spine. Pure-moment flexibility and failure testing was conducted on 41 male spinal segments (O–C2, C4–C5, C6–C7) in a pure-moment test frame and the results were compared with a previous study of females. Failures were conducted at approximately 90N-m/s. In extension, the male upper cervical spine (O–C2) fails at a moment of 49.5 (s.d. 17.6)N-m and at an angle of 42.4° (s.d. 8.0°). In flexion, the mean moment at failure is 39.0 (s.d. 6.3°) N-m and an angle of 58.7° (s.d. 5.1°). The difference in strength between flexion and extension is not statistically significant. The difference in the angles is statistically significant. The upper cervical spine was significantly stronger than the lower cervical spine in both flexion and extension. The male upper cervical spine was significantly stiffer than the female and significantly stronger than the female in flexion. Odontoid fractures were the most common injury produced in extension, suggesting a tensile mechanism due to tensile loads in the odontoid ligamentous complex.},

  abstract = {This study explores the inertial effects of the head and torso on cervical spine dynamics with the specific goal of determining whether the head mass can provide a constraining cervical spine end condition. The hypothesis was tested using a low friction impact surface and a pocketing foam impact surface. Impact orientation was also varied. Tests were conducted on whole unembalmed heads and cervical spines using a drop track system to produce impact velocities on the order of 3.2 ms−1. Data for the head impact forces and the reactions at T1 were recorded and the tests were also imaged at 1000 frames s−1. Injuries occurred 2–19 ms following head impact and prior to significant head motion. Average compressive load a failure was 1727 ± 387 N. Decoupling was observed between the head and T1. Cervical spine loading due to head rebound constituted up to 54 ± 16\% of the total axial neck load for padded impacts and up to 38 ± 30\% of the total axial neck load for rigid impacts. Dynamic buckling was also observed; including first-order modes and transient higher-order modes which shifted the structure from a primarily compressive mode of deformation to various bending modes. These experiments demonstrate that in the absence of head pocketing, the head mass can provide sufficient constraint to cause cervical spine injury. The results also show that cervical spinal injury dynamics are complex, and that a large sample size of experimentally produced injuries will be necessary to develop comprehensive neck injury models and criteria.},

  abstract = {Cervical traumas are among the most common events leading to serious spinal cord injuries. While models are often used to better understand injury mechanisms, experimental data for their validation remain sparse, particularly regarding articular facets. The aim of this study was to assess the behavior of cervical FSUs under quasi-static flexion with a specific focus on facet tracking. 9 cadaveric cervical FSUs were imaged and loaded under a 10 Nm flexion moment, exerted incrementally, while biplanar X-rays were acquired at each load increment. The relative vertebral and facet rotations and displacements were assessed using radio-opaque markers implanted in each vertebra and CT-based reconstructions registered on the radiographs. The only failures obtained were due to specimen preparation, indicating a failure moment of cervical FSUs greater than 10 Nm in quasistatic flexion. Facet motions displayed a consistent anterior sliding and a variable pattern regarding their normal displacement. The present study offers insight on the behavior of cervical FSUs under quasi-static flexion beyond physiological thresholds with accurate facet tracking. The data provided should prove useful to further understand injury mechanisms and validate models.},
